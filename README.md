# THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OSCILLATORY NEURAL NETWORKS WITH NANO-ELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (NEMS)
This repository contains the code for my study 'The implementation of oscillatory neural networks with nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS)' submitted to 'Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering'. The script hamming_distance.m can be used to reproduce the figures from the paper; it is currently set to produce Fig. 5, but it can be easily modified to produce over Recognition Accuracy vs Hamming Distance plots. Make sure that you download the letters.zip folder as it contains the patterns used for the study. If you wish to model the effects of white Gaussian noise on the networks, be sure to download the sde solver from https://github.com/horchler/SDETools?tab=readme-ov-file. Finally, should you wish to run this code, please note that the computational times are quite long.
Aditionally, the EMNIST folder contains the files used to simulate a network designed to recognise EMNIST handwritten digits
